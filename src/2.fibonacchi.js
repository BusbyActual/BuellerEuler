  ### Problem

 Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

let fibonacci = (max, options) => {
  let limit = max || 4000000;
  let counterEven = [2];
  let counterOdd = [1];
  let last = 1;
  let curr = 2;
  let result = 0;

  if (max < 3) {
    return 'Max must be greater than 2';
  }

  while(curr < limit) {
     let next  = last + curr;


     if (last % 2 === 0) {
       counterEven.push(next);
     } else {
       counterOdd.push(next);
     }
  }

  return result;
